**Development Quick Start**

* You will need Node.JS since the Sass is compiled with a webpack pipeline. 

* `make install` to install dependencies.
* `make server` to start the development server - you will need to Ctrl-C and restart if there are CSS changes since they require re-compilation.
* `make build` to output the static HTML to the `_site/` folder.
